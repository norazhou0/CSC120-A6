- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance saves me time because I don't need to recreate classes that share some attributes. While making subclasses, use "extends" and "super" to inherit from the parent class. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

1. Read the instruction carefully
2. Start with small bits of code
3. Write pseudocode to go through the logic between classes and methods
4. Handle exeptions in methods
5. Test in main
6. Add documentation
